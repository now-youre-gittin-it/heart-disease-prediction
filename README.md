# heart-disease-prediction

Python project to apply:
- Logistic Regression 
- SVM
- multi-layer perceptron, and 
- Random Forest 
to predict occurrence of heart disease. <br>
This project involves extensive work with sci-kit learn (aka sklearn). <br>
The goal is to create and end to end project with deployment, so the readme will be updated once the modeling phase is complete.
